This summary will be superseded by an on-site visit with Miro the owner
of my sister company BV Electric who will perform the work.

Sorry to disappoint you, I'm busy. I work with 4 Licensed Electrical Contractors 
and . . . BV Electric is the best match for your job. You get competitive prices 
that are better than I can provide. To keep the rates relatively low, 
BV Electric does not buy advertising.

They rely on good customer reviews on Yelp etc. They have many excellent
5 star reviews on Yelp.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/bv-electric-san-francisco.

They have become quite popular as you can tell by reading the yelp reviews.
Miro is a Licensed Electrical Contractor Owner and Estimator with 17 years of
experience. He spent seven years working for others and now he has ten more
years in business as a licensed contractor for a total of seventeen years.

My specialties are Same Day Service, Old Houses, Small jobs & Prompt Emergency
Response 24/7/365 I keep track of the jobs I refer. I want to be sure they turn 
out perfectly. I do get a small commission which I use for follow-up.

If there is anything less than 100% perfect or 5 stars or you're not happy 
in anyway I need to know about it. 

PS - I did forward your text to Nicoleta who will take your call in the office.
