It is necessary to budget for contingencies.  Extra work may be                 
required to correct the best of intentions by other trades.                     
There are a range of activities and conditions can negatively                   
impact construction team work.  We must work together to cut or                 
eliminate risk or we will see our profits disappear.  Effective                 
progress is our goal.  With good planning and steady work the                   
contingency money will not be needed.  At the conclusion of the                 
job I will audit this list and the total price will be adjusted
