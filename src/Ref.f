\ REF.SEQ       Reference word REF              by Leon Dent

comment:

  Used in the form  REF <word>

  REF hunts out references of <word> in all occurences of colon words

  Much of this file has been cannibalized from the files DECOM.SEQ and
  WORDS.SEQ, also a few words ( .VYET, EXECUTION-CLASS, ?KEYPAUSE etc )
  are re-used so the above files must be loaded.

  REF           captures CFA of word
  (REF)         searches from vocabulary to vocabulary
  .RVOCWORDS    searches within each vocabulary
  R.NAME        searches within each colon word, prints out matches
